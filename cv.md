## Briefly About Myself:

>> When it is obvious that the goals cannot be reached, don't adjust the goals, adjust the action steps!
***- Confucius***

*Having started my career as an ecologist with scientific background, I've became a profficient expert on Sustainable Development (incluging ESG and Digital Transformations).*

*But life is complicated, and after 2020, almost all non-commercial civil society organizations (including the one I've worked for) have been closed in Belarus. That's why I shifted my professional focus on IT-sphere. I believe that my patience and ability to gain new skills will lead me through this path of becoming ***a proficient Frontend Developer***.*

*My distinguishing features are a social and ecoIogical responsibility, high moral and ethical values. I enjoy complex non-trivial tasks and personal challenges. My great professional acievement is a co-authorship in the UN IPBES Global Assessment on biodiversity and ecosystem services [https://ipbes.net/global-assessment](https://ipbes.net/global-assessment) (2020 WIN WIN Gothenburg Sustainability Award, EuroNatur 2021 Award) that confirms developed soft skills as well as a high level of written and spoken English.*

***My future dream is to work with inspired team and create outstanding demanded apps. Is it your team maybe?*** :blush:
